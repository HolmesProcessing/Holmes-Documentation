Totem's Services are pretty simple to understand. They build upon JSON as a
messaging format, use a RESTful API and are completely independent of Totem itself.
The Scala you need to add one is, in most cases, as simple as it can be:
copy and paste.

This chapter contains detailed information about how Services communicate with
Totem, access samples, how to write a new Service and a Service example.
